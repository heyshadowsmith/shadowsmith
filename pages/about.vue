      Hey, I'm Shadow Smith, a Vue developer & API designer
    </h1>
    <p>
      During my career, I have discovered that opportunities for growth are limitless with the power of current web technologies, and as a result, I have developed an insatiable passion for creatively solving problems using visual design, code, and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have lead a team to build software used by Disney, Hulu, Upwork, Tinder, NBC, and more at Business Credit Reports, Inc., North America's largest independant provider or business credit information.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had hundreds of discovery calls with C-suite executives and integrated APIs into some of the nation's largest media companies' internal systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I'm at <a target="_blank" href="https://openly.com">Openly</a> as a Senior Software Engineer to help push the insurance industry forward using <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a>, and Serverless Functions.
