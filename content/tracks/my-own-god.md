I live a cut and dry life<br>
I love myself more than anyone or anything<br>
And I only do actions and affiliate with those<br>
Who make me love my existence more than I would if I were alone<br>
If any temptation or anyone dampens my love<br>
for my own life in any way, I cut it out<br>
My happiness is my top priority<br>
But if you add joy to my days, I will return the favor<br>
That's what friends are for<br>
But ultimately I have realized that pure happiness comes from within<br>
And everything else beautiful about life enhances the experience<br>
<br>
I see myself as my own God<br>
<br>
Recently, I found a part of myself I looked away from<br>
The thing is, I didn't know it was missing until I found it<br>
It's a liberating feeling to feel whole even when you're alone<br>
But don't forget to believe<br>
<br>
Once you forget what it is to have faith<br>
You cease to exist within your own mind<br>
And it's a dark place when you can't even believe in yourself<br>
It's a dark place when you can't even believe in yourself<br>
<br>
I see myself as my own God<br>
<br>
It is refreshing to take a step back and borrow another's mind<br>
Because once we all realize we are fundamentally the same<br>
We can adjust our intentions accordingly to move in the same way<br>
That is peace<br>
<br>
Goodnight, brother
