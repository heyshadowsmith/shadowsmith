I Believe you can't see what I see<br>
You can try, but you will never find the picture in front of me<br>
You beauty on the outside and in<br>
is what I needed is what I needed<br>
<br>
I'm on the outside looking in<br>
And I will do it again and again<br>
I know you can't see how good you are<br>
Trapped in your heart<br>
But I'm looking in<br>
<br>
If the stars had eyes, they couldn't see the splendor of the skies<br>
Yet the scene is one and the same to us<br>
We are on the ground looking up<br>
At the vivid imagery above us<br>
I know we can see the shine of the stars<br>
While we're looking up<br>
<br>
I'm not saying you're a star<br>
But I'm not saying you're not<br>
The truth is the concept is similar<br>
From where I am I can see your heart<br>
You have a goodness I talk about<br>
Even when you are a far<br>
I could hear it in your voice from the start<br>
<br>
You will never want to leave here
