It's easy to get jaded about the things we were made with<br>
There's a million like us who are vulnerable and naked<br>
Fortunate doesn't begin to describe the breaks we were handed<br>
So hold on to who or whatever holds you together no matter what<br>
and you'll keep it<br>
<br>
We don't know what tomorrow brings<br>
But we'd sure like to be prepared for it<br>
Because the lives we were born with are valuable to us<br>
and we're lucky to have them<br>
to have them to have them<br>
<br>
If there is a guardian in the home you were raised in<br>
Walk through the door and show them your appreciation<br>
Fortunate doesn't begin to describe the chances we were given<br>
So hold on to who or whatever holds you together no matter what<br>
and you'll keep it<br>
<br>
By looking at the pictures and listening to the worlds words<br>
I know I'm a lucky one a lucky one indeed<br>
When someone looks in your eyes the green eyes monster should be seen<br>
Because your a lucky one a lucky one like me
