I'm gonna count to one two three<br>
Yeah, reach for the ceiling<br>
Let me see you jump, let me see you jump<br>
I'm gonna count to one two tres four cinco six<br>
Do it for the kicks<br>
Let me hear you scream, let me hear you count up<br>
<br>
It's night now, I'm slightly strung out<br>
From wreckin' my hearing with the bass loud<br>
Ear drums pound on tempo to my favorite song's intro<br>
We aren't sleepin' til we hit the floor<br>
We will dance our body sore<br>
<br>
Up down up and down<br>
Up down up down up and down<br>
<br>
I'm gonna count to one two three<br>
Yeah, reach for the ceiling<br>
Let me see you jump, let me see you jump<br>
I'm gonna count to one two tres four cinco six<br>
Do it for the kicks<br>
Let me hear you scream, let me hear you count up<br>
<br>
In the A.M. I have no plans<br>
You ready to break the living room in?<br>
Get this place a movin' with the music<br>
There's nothing more to it<br>
We ain't crashin' til we hit the floor<br>
We will dance til we can't no more<br>
<br>
Up down up and down<br>
Up down up down up and down<br>
<br>
I'm gonna count to one two three<br>
Yeah, reach for the ceiling<br>
Let me see you jump, let me see you jump<br>
I'm gonna count to one two tres four cinco six<br>
Do it for the kicks<br>
Let me hear you scream, let me hear you count up
