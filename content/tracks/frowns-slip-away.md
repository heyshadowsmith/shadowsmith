Have you ever been lost in thought about how your life is<br>
Have you ever been down on your luck or ran out of fucks to give<br>
Here is a remedy to heal your wounds just a simple melody to sing to<br>
<br>
So here's to the songs<br>
Where everyone know the notes<br>
and everyone sings the words<br>
and everyone hums the verse<br>
So here’s to the lyrics<br>
The ones that make you smile when you hear it<br>
The lines that get lost in your head<br>
And know exactly what to say <br>
To make frowns slip away<br>
<br>
Have you ever stared at the clouds out a car window<br>
Wondering what turn to take, and where it will go<br>
Have you ever felt so afraid of what choices are right<br>
That you only do what your told and lose the will to fight<br>
<br>
Everyone gets beat down picked up and tossed about <br>
Most don’t make a sound, but others do<br>
We take what we learn and sing it like a bird<br>
So we’ll flock together to survive the weather just like birds do<br>
<br>
So here’s to my song<br>
Come on and sing along<br>
If you’re worried, depressed, or stressed<br>
I promise it’s for the best<br>
I know my lyrics<br>
Will grab you just for a minute<br>
And know just what to say<br>
To make your frown slip away
