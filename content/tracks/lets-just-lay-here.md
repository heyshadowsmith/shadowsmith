So It's been awhile now (It's been awhile now)<br>
Since you came around to let me<br>
Show you what you adore in me, love in me<br>
But it's okay I wouldn't want it any other way<br>
but right now but right now but right now<br>
<br>
Lets just lay here under the white clouds<br>
We're safe and sound right here as one<br>
And lets just wait here and count the breaths we take<br>
Just to have you fall asleep here right inside my arms<br>
Right inside my arms<br>
<br>
I'm not going to lie, I always think of those eyes<br>
More than I'll willingly admit<br>
But if I saw them all the time<br>
They wouldn't be on my mind<br>
Watching my neurons excite<br>
When you're by my side<br>
<br>
So i'll just lay here all alone tonight<br>
Because I know you're fine<br>
Because I know you're mine<br>
I don't need you here all the time<br>
But on occasion it's nice to free my mind<br>
with your fingers locked in mine<br>
<br>
Separation makes the heart grow fonder<br>
Separation makes the heart grow stronger<br>
Separation makes the heart grow fonder<br>
And when I see you it's twice as better
