I have too much respect for my heart<br>
To let yours crease up my seams and tear me apart<br>
At our core we are alike, but your eyes speak of spite<br>
Just like faith, your tongue isn't real<br>
Or at least the words you defend aren't real<br>
Like the snakes that sleep in your bed deceiving you into believing you have a friend<br>
Where is your head? Cast out your line to try and catch it again<br>
But all you reel in is a taste of that scent that keeps you going<br>
Forever asking yourself, what's the use in eternally glowing when in the dark alone knowing<br>
<br>
that you did this to yourself<br>
Karma's a bitch, and she's bad for your health<br>
But in this one life I'd beg for hell to pay your way in<br>
Because the places you've been are stained of deceit<br>
Trees left to weep as the world can't wipe it's hands clean of you<br>
Forget how to speak or stop thinking, clearing the mental pollution in the room<br>
Leaving clean thoughts to breathe, leaving clean thoughts to thrive<br>
Just open your eyes for a second and count<br>
Just count the hate you've collected<br>
Your spine is infected<br>
<br>
Where is your head?<br>
Tell me where is your head<br>
Your spine is infected<br>
Where is your head?<br>
Where is your head?<br>
<br>
Where is your head? Cast out your line to try and catch it again<br>
Where is your head?<br>
Where is your head?
