Never mind their talking down the dreamers<br>
Our world is standing still<br>
They wake up much too much,<br>
But see our Castle will be high above their arrows<br>
Our glasses flowing still,<br>
I'm remembering you standing in the whitest dress I'd known<br>
<br>
Have I always loved you?<br>
Have I always known?<br>
Have I always loved you alone?<br>
<br>
Never mind the storm that keeps us in at night,<br>
The cold rain on the leaves<br>
The wind is much too much,<br>
But you and I are safe here laughing at the table<br>
Maybe I should look away,<br>
But I only see you standing<br>
In the whitest dress I'd known<br>
<br>
Have I always loved you?<br>
Have I always known?<br>
Have I always loved you alone?<br>
<br>
Have I always loved you?<br>
Have I always known?<br>
Have I always loved you alone?
