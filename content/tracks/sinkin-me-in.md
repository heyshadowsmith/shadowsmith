Today started just like every other day<br>
Laced my red shoes I was on my way<br>
Headed out to town to see if anyone's about<br>
That's where I saw her, we passed on the street<br>
I didn't get her name, but she smiled at me<br>
Freezing the feet beneath my knees<br>
And damn'd if I couldn't speak<br>
<br>
This girl was like wet concrete on the sidewalk beneath my feet, oh<br>
Sinking me in and keeping there<br>
Yeah, with eyes like waves on the sand beneath my feet, oh<br>
She was sinking me in and keeping me there<br>
<br>
Looking back on the day before I regretted not getting her digits<br>
Now I'm thinking of ways to get on her mind the way she's been on mine, yeah<br>
My best shot is to go down town to see if she's walking around<br>
So I did just that, and like before, damn'd if I can make a sound<br>
<br>
Then one day I was walking up on the spot I froze on those days<br>
And on a red wood bench sat the most beautiful girl ever made<br>
Yeah, I mustered up the courage to sit down beside of her turn my head and say<br>
<br>
You are like wet concrete on the sidewalk beneath my feet, oh<br>
Sinking me in and keeping me there<br>
Yeah, with eyes like waves on the sand beneath my feet, oh<br>
You're sinking me in and keeping me there
