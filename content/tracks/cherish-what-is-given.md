Is anyone really sure of what we're doing here?<br>
Trees grow leaves, yet they fall to our feet with such ease.<br>
<br>
What are your plans for the day?<br>
Will you waste your time wishing it away, or will you<br>
Take what you are given and make it one worth living?<br>
<br>
If you're mind is closed to the minutes,<br>
Do what it takes to unlock what it takes to open it<br>
<br>
From the top looking down, we realize we have a while to go<br>
We have a ways to go<br>
Until we are complete with the feat of believing what we see.<br>
<br>
I've been having struggles as well<br>
But I've found out how to deal with it through sound.<br>
<br>
With my head resting on my hands,<br>
I will always cherish what I've been given.
