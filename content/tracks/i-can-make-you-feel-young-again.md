Take me now, take me anywhere you're going<br>
'Cause I can't stay here, I won't make it long<br>
And this piece of my soul you're controlling<br>
In this time and this space where we belong<br>
<br>
It's worsening<br>
It's breaking down<br>
As a reel of thread unwinding<br>
You're surfacing<br>
Just to take me down<br>
When I feel like I'm dead you're reviving me<br>
When I feel like I'm dead you're reviving me<br>
<br>
A billion stars and here we are<br>
The same bit of dirt holding our weight<br>
And before it drags us under<br>
I can make you feel young again<br>
And I can make you feel young again<br>
<br>
I can make you feel nothing at all for the years<br>
That led you here<br>
Now all your tears that are falling will never show<br>
I can make you feel young again<br>
<br>
Your breathing is quickening<br>
Take my lungs, I owe you<br>
Lost and cold now<br>
There's a place in my arms I can keep you<br>
<br>
A billion stars and here we are<br>
The same bit of dirt holding our weight<br>
And before it drags us under<br>
I can make you feel young again<br>
And I can make you feel young again<br>
<br>
I can make you feel nothing at all for the years<br>
That led you here<br>
Now all your tears that are falling will never show<br>
I can make you feel young again<br>
<br>
I can make you feel nothing at all for the years<br>
That led you here<br>
Now all your tears that are falling will never show<br>
I can make you feel young again
