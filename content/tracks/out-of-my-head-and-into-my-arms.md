I swear to you, girl when I find you I'll give you the world<br>
I'll give you what I've saved for so long (so long)<br>
Just promise me your heart, and I promise you will never ever shed a tear<br>
But never holding you close is my biggest fear<br>
<br>
Let me just ask one question now<br>
Why settle for someone that only brings you down?<br>
It has and will never make sense to me<br>
But if I could convince you just to believe<br>
Just to believe that I am your missing piece<br>
You could finally, you could finally<br>
<br>
Get out of my head, and into my arms<br>
Into my arms (Into my arms)<br>
<br>
Lets be honest now, most of us don't get it<br>
But that's not always true<br>
I will show you the proof with my actions towards you<br>
Picking you up when your plans fall through<br>
I know I will grow on you, I will grow on you now<br>
<br>
In my arms I will keep you safe<br>
I will keep you sane in this lonely place<br>
Where all faces look the same<br>
And finding trust is a mental drain<br>
I know how you feel, I said I know how you feel<br>
Now break your habits, and make your heartbeat real now
