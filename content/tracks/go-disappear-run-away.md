(Go with me, Run with me, Go with me, Disappear)<br>
<br>
 If I ask you to please never leave<br>
Will you realize I can't rest without you?<br>
Either here or far<br>
I can feel you where you are<br>
If I tell you to never lose yourself<br>
Will you know at last that I<br>
Want you to go, that I want you to disappear, that I want you to run away<br>
with me, you see?<br>
<br>
If I ask you to forgive me<br>
Will you recognize that I'm a human?<br>
Either here or far<br>
I will see you as you are<br>
If I tell you to let go of the past<br>
Will you know at last that I<br>
Want you to go, that I want you to disappear, that I want you to run away<br>
With me, you see?
