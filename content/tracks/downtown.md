Lets go downtown tonight<br>
We will have a good time<br>
I swear we will have a good night<br>
Lets go downtown tonight<br>
We will have a good time<br>
I swear I swear I swear<br>
<br>
Just take my hand and I will show you all of my favorite places<br>
We will walk the sidewalk and dream about being as tall as skyscrapers<br>
Large and in charge is what we are<br>
When we are as free as the street performers that sing<br>
La la la<br>
<br>
Just follow me through these concrete streets<br>
Paved with the memory of our feet<br>
One step after another is what are hearts need<br>
Large and in charge is what we are<br>
When we are as free as the street performers that sing<br>
La la la
