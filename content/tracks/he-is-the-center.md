He is the center of everything I know,<br>
and without him, I wouldn’t be who I am<br>
<br>
He is the model of what I wish to be<br>
Working so hard for his family<br>
<br>
So this song goes out to you<br>
You’re the one I look up to<br>
Maybe one day I can be the spitting image<br>
of your face<br>
<br>
He is the one<br>
Who taught me right from wrong<br>
He didn’t introduce me to music<br>
But he influenced this song<br>
<br>
Without him in my life<br>
I wouldn’t be the man I am today<br>
Maybe one day when he looks at me<br>
He’ll see his own face<br>
<br>
So this song goes out to you<br>
You’re the one I look up to<br>
Maybe one day I can be the spitting image<br>
Of your face<br>
<br>
You work so hard<br>
And you never speak a word of it<br>
I don’t know how to pay for what you’ve done<br>
<br>
Maybe just maybe this song will work for now<br>
Maybe just maybe this song will work for now<br>
Maybe just maybe this song will work for now<br>
Maybe just maybe this song will work for now
