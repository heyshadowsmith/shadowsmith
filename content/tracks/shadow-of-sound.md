I love you<br>
And I haven’t held you yet<br>
I haven’t met you yet<br>
But I do, I do, I do<br>
I love you<br>
And the sound of your laugh<br>
And I haven’t heard it yet<br>
But I do<br>
<br>
You’re my shadow of sound<br>
And you’re gonna  to make your family proud<br>
Just by being, being who you are<br>
You’re my shadow of sound<br>
And you’re heart is fused to my soul<br>
Tighter than you’ll ever know<br>
Because you, you are, you are my Echo<br>
<br>
I know you<br>
And I haven’t seen you yet<br>
But my heart will steal my breath<br>
When I do, I do, I do<br>
I know you<br>
And I haven’t spoken to you yet<br>
But I'll cherish every moment when I do<br>
<br>
You’re my shadow of sound<br>
And you’re gonna  to make your family proud<br>
Just by being, being who you are<br>
You’re my shadow of sound<br>
And you’re heart is fused to my soul<br>
Tighter than you’ll ever know<br>
Because you, you are, you are my Echo<br>
<br>
I’ll sing you these words to fall asleep<br>
You are my masterpiece<br>
You know you’re my everything?<br>
Yeah, You know you’re my everything?<br>
I’ll sing you these words to fall asleep<br>
You are my masterpiece<br>
You know you’re my everything?<br>
Yeah, You know…<br>
<br>
You’re my shadow of sound<br>
And you’re gonna  to make your family proud<br>
Just by being, being who you are<br>
You’re my shadow of sound<br>
And you’re heart is fused to my soul<br>
Tighter than you’ll ever know<br>
Because you, you are, you are my Echo
