May these words be the first<br>
To find your ears<br>
The world is brighter than the sun<br>
Now that you're here<br>
Though your eyes will need some time to adjust<br>
To the overwhelming light surrounding us<br>
<br>
I'll give you everything I have<br>
I'll teach you everything I know<br>
I will always hold you close<br>
But I will learn to let you go<br>
I will soften every edge<br>
I'll hold the world to it's best<br>
With every heartbeat I have left<br>
I will defend your every breath<br>
And I'll do better<br>
<br>
'Ð¡ause you are loved<br>
You are loved more than you know<br>
I hereby pledge all of my days<br>
To prove it so<br>
Though your heart is far too young to realize<br>
The unimaginable light you hold inside<br>
<br>
I'll give you everything I have<br>
I'll teach you everything I know<br>
I will always hold you close<br>
But I will learn to let you go<br>
I will rearrange the stars<br>
Pull 'em down to where you are<br>
With every heartbeat I have left<br>
I'll defend your every breath
