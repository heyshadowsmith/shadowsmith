I love to go down to the water and sit on the dock<br>
And hear the blue birds sing to each other<br>
I watch the ripples on the surface<br>
When a leaf from a tree falls into<br> 
The liquid mirror holding the sky<br>
The liquid mirror holding the sky<br>
<br>
I love to lay back with my feet in the water<br>
And stare up into the beyond<br>
I always wonder how such beauty can be made<br>
But there is no being creative enough for this place<br>
There is no being creative enough<br>
There is no being creative enough for this place<br>
There is no being creative enough<br>
<br>
I see many things<br>
Yeah, I see what I see<br>
I see many thing up in the clouds,<br>
But nothing's looking back at me<br>
Yeah, nothing's looking back at me<br>
<br>
There is no being creative enough for this place<br>
There is no being creative enough<br>
There is no being creative enough for this place<br>
There is no being creative enough
