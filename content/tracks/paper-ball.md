Woke up and loved how I can be and feel as great as me<br>
But am I truly free?<br>
<br>
I miss how it was, but at the end of it all<br>
We are a paper ball<br>
<br>
Promises told by you about everything you'd do got heavy and fell through<br>
You abandoned us to take the fall<br>
We are a paper ball<br>
<br>
Just like the mistakes you made,<br>
We were crumbled up and tossed away<br>
Our liberty in your hands<br>
Freedom when seen but at second glance,<br>
We have so much less<br>
<br>
Woke up and loved how I can be and feel as great as me<br>
But am I truly free?<br>
<br>
With your greed, you still stand tall<br>
We are a paper ball<br>
<br>
I miss how it was, but at the end of it all<br>
We are a paper ball
