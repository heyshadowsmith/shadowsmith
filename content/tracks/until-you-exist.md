Yeah, I'm waiting to see your face in an unexpected place<br>
But if that's all I'm waiting for<br>
I will be searching forever<br>
Until I forget you exist<br>
Until I forget you exist, yeah<br>
Until I forget you exist<br>
I will be searching forever<br>
Until I forget you exist<br>
<br>
I'm not gonna lie<br>
waking up alone for so long has caught me by surprise<br>
and I'm sure, you feel the same in whichever bed you lie awake<br>
take it from me it does the heart good to get off the sheets<br>
and fully live out each day<br>
Yeah, you must forget about me to be happy today<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'm waiting to see your face in an unexpected place<br>
But if that's all I'm waiting for<br>
I will be searching forever<br>
Until I forget you exist<br>
Until I forget you exist, yeah<br>
Until I forget you exist<br>
I will be searching forever<br>
Until I forget you exist<br>
<br>
All the "what ifs", "ands", or "buts"<br>
Are on the edge of my mind at night<br>
When I'm trying to close my eyes<br>
I will admit you keep me awake<br>
With the mystery of if we ever touched the same air<br>
I need not care<br>
But every other person is happy with their other there<br>
Yeah, I must forget about you,<br>
So I will see you soon<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'm waiting to see your face in an unexpected place<br>
But if that's all I'm waiting for<br>
I will be searching forever<br>
Until I forget you exist<br>
Until I forget you exist, yeah<br>
Until I forget you exist<br>
I will be searching forever<br>
Until I forget you exist
