Time means nothing without moments<br>
And moments mean nothing without memories<br>
What separates you from the “you” of yesterday is change<br>
So make for damn sure that change is in the best way<br>
<br>
You and I are the same; <br>
We’re made of flesh and bone<br>
But bones can only bend so far until they just break<br>
Lets scream for their sake, <br>
Lets take our time and reiterate the actions<br>
that kept the strong mentally alive<br>
Causing a moment in the hopefuls eyes burning a memory of inspired glow<br>
directly into their minds<br>
<br>
We are alive,<br>
some on the outside and some within<br>
Some with skin so paper thin you can see every experience that has ever affected them<br>
in their life<br>
<br>
If you are stability gifted,<br> 
reach out your hand and answer the clumsy one’s wishes<br>
Give a silent child a voice to avoid this world’s pestilence and its damages<br>
Be the one they aspire to be<br>
driving them severely fearless<br>
<br>
Time means nothing without moments<br>
And moments mean nothing without memories<br>
What separates you from the “you” of yesterday is change<br>
So make for damn sure that change is in the best way<br>
<br>
It’s never too late to change<br>
It’s never too late<br>
It's never too late<br>
<br>
I don’t preach the bible, but my message is the same<br>
It’s never too late to change in the best way<br>
<br>
My message is the same<br>
It’s never too late to change<br>
