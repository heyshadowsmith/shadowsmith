I am unaware of your face, or when you will appear<br>
but I'm doing everything I can to forget you're not here<br>
Patiently waiting here alone saving who I am for someone I don't know<br>
I hope and pray the path I chose was right, but I won't know until it's time<br>
I won't know 'til it's time<br>
<br>
We must not change our names, we must not forget<br>
For every soul in this world another matches it<br>
We are the same, We will not forget ourselves for the world<br>
<br>
I am the one you've never seen, I hope you are doing everything to be with me<br>
but you won't know my name until it's time<br>
Yeah, I know you are waiting all alone<br>
Saving who you are for a guy you've never known<br>
I hope and pray you know I'm just out of sight<br>
Unknowingly known not right out of mind<br>
You won't know 'til it's time<br>
<br>
Our biggest fear in life is to be passing up<br>
The owner of the name we are waiting to show up<br>
Our biggest fear in life is to be passing up<br>
The owner of the name we are waiting to complete us
