It's an amazing place where I am<br>
Away from your space,<br>
and I now have a smile on my face<br>
<br>
I'm counting down the days until I meet her<br>
Until I see her for the first time<br>
Time will stop by her eyes,<br>
And that'll be fine<br>
<br>
There's only so long I can scream at the clock<br>
and say everything will be fine<br>
After spending way too long trying to find my dime,<br>
And I'm not talking about change<br>
unless it's between you and I<br>
Where ever you are, I promise I'm your type,<br>
Yeah, that's right<br>
I'm not lyin' or a tiger<br>
<br>
I've been telling myself that I'm insane<br>
I need to buy the first ticket I find for the sane train,<br>
But I'm beginning to see it'll all be in vain<br>
Because I'll just end up in the same place<br>
With this silly smile upon my face singin'<br>
<br>
Pull me in close<br>
Where ever you are<br>
Don't lose hope<br>
I swear what you want I can be that<br>
I swear I will find you believe it<br>
Please please
